**The Boggle game.**  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boggle is a word game designed by Allan Turoff and distributed by Hasbro. It involves a board made up of 16 cubic dice, where each die has a letter printed on each of its 6 sides. At the beginning of the game, the 16 dice are shaken and randomly distributed into a 4-by-4 tray, with only the top sides of the dice visible. The players compete to accumulate points by building valid words from the dice, according to these rules:  

1. A valid word must be composed by following a sequence of adjacent diceâ€”two dice are adjacent if they are horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbors.
2. A valid word can use each die at most once.
3. A valid word must contain at least 3 letters.
4. A valid word must be in the dictionary (which typically does not contain proper nouns).

Scoring. Valid words are scored according to their length, using this table:

| Word Length | Points |
| --- | ----------- |
| 3-4 | 1 |
| 5 | 2 |
| 6 | 3 |
| 7 | 5 |
| 8+ | 11 |

**The Qu special case.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the English language, the letter Q is almost always followed by the letter U. Consequently, the side of one die is printed with the two-letter sequence Qu instead of Q (and this two-letter sequence must be used together when forming words). When scoring, Qu counts as two letters; for example, the word QuEUE scores as a 5-letter word even though it is formed by following a sequence of only 4 dice.
